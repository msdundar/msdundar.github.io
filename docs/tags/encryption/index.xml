      <description>Checking SSL certificates on a browser is easy. Just click the green lock icon and you&amp;rsquo;re good to go. But what if doing the same in a more hacker way? This is where openssl comes into play.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start by checking the SSL certificate of this website:
openssl s_client -connect www.serhatdundar.com:443 depth=2 C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA depth=1 C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.</description>

      <description>Hybrid Encryption: Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption Combined Both symmetric and asymmetric encryption has advantages and disadvantages. So, which one should we use? Well, nowadays we often use them together. Asymmetric encryption is often used to exchange private keys between parties securely. In other words, parties who would communicate establish an asymmetric encryption protocol in the beginning just to exchange private keys. When the private key exchange is completed, they keep communicating by using symmetric encryption - which is faster than asymmetric encryption.</description>

      <title>Encrypting Sensitive Data With Rails</title>

      <description>The most recent versions (5.1 and 5.2) of Ruby on Rails has shipped with a new feature named as encrypted credentials which replaces the secrets.yml, and enables you to keep sensitive data in an encrypted file named as config/credentials.yml.enc.
However, this feature only works with a single file that is config/credentials.yml.enc. Recently we needed to add some data in our repository, which we wanted to keep as encrypted, but that also didn&amp;rsquo;t really fit into the credentials.</description>
