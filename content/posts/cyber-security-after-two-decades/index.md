### Two Decades Ago

I got my first computer in 1998. I remember having my father pay around 2500$ for it. GPUs back then didn't look any
different than a dull sound card with visible electronic units on it. They didn't look like a race car with fancy
cooling units, adaptive coloring, and huge fans on, as they're today.

1998 was also the year of [CIH (Chernobyl)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIH_(computer_virus)). CIH was able to destroy
a system BIOS, and a BIOS chip replacement was needed afterward. It was a devastating moment when CIH destroyed my PC
as an 8-year old kid, who was only interested in playing Street Fighter there.

Then I got a new PC, the Internet adoption started to speed up. Chat rooms and forums have been the thing at the
beginning of the 2000s. I've been spending most of my time in the chatrooms of a Harry Potter related website as a 10
years old kid. One day in the chat room I noticed a group of people with colorful usernames, blue, red, yellow - they
all looked just amazing! Mine was dull black, not even bold or italic styling, as the majority of the room. Of course,
they didn't tell me how they did it, but it was something very cool and unique for me.

These two events made me learn HTML and CSS all by myself, and probably shaped my whole life. If you are a native
English speaker this may not sounds like an achievement to you, but back then I had literally zero tech books written
in my native language, which is Turkish and I didn't know any English either! Learning resources on the Internet have
been quite limited, very often they didn't even exist, and using the Internet with a 56K modem was an expensive
activity.

One thing led to another and I started learning about cyber security from online forums, probably as a result of
the traumatic CIH experience. I don't know if the term "Cyber Security" existed back then, but how we call this field
of interest was just "hacking". I say "field of interest" because Cyber Security wasn't really an industry back then.

For a couple of years, I was heavily invested in cyber security. I was trying all tools I can find online, such as
keyloggers, trojans, viruses, and I was testing all vulnerabilities that I can find on random targets. Typical
script-kiddie story. Looking at my [zone-h](https://www.zone-h.org/) profile (no, I will not tell my username to you)
at the end of the day with pride and honor was a daily activity.

I also witnessed the development and progress of "hacking" communities in Turkey from the beginning. Turkey today, is
still one of the most active countries in cyber-security, together with India, the USA, Brazil, Ukraine, and Russia.

However, I never earned any money from cyber security, and I only did software engineering during my career. Maybe it's
because being a "pentester" or a "security engineer" wasn't even a thing back then.

### Getting Certified or Not?

I don't believe in IT certifications. They rarely prove if an engineer is capable, especially in the software
engineering field. I also find it funny and pointless when I see profiles on Linkedin with _"10x AWS certified"_
headlines. If you haven't done any meaningful infrastructure work on a large scale, you can have a thousand certificates
and they won't mean anything.

However, the certification business is still taken seriously in cyber security, compared to other fields.

I only find certifications useful because of a set of structured studies one needs to complete for obtaining them.
This structured way of studying for them reminds me the college, and this is a feeling I enjoy once a year, or once
every two years.

I'm usually a well-organized person, but I struggle to stay focused when I'm not very interested in a subject. I
leverage certification training to ease these motivational pains. They simply keep me on track, and I like not having
to do study planning for myself sometimes. Long story short, I recently decided to get a CompTIA Security+
certification.

### CompTIA Security+

If you aren't familiar with cyber security certifications, CompTIA is one of the certifications that covers everything.
Therefore it's not good for specializing on a specific topic or demonstrating expertise in a particular area. It can
also, be considered as an entry-level certificate, but also don't expect it to be so easy because they're literally
shoveling you with content, almost about anything.

I followed the [CompTIA Security+ course](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/) of Jason Dion on Udemy. It's
a comprehensive resource with 22 hours of video, and 168 pages of study notes. However, I gave many breaks when I'm
following the course and did further studying on the topics that I'm interested in. Namely, SSL/TLS, hashing functions,
symmetric and asymmetric encryption, public key infrastructure (PKI), and so on. I watched over 70 videos on Youtube
about these topics and refreshed my knowledge. On average a single YouTube video was 15 minutes, so it took around 18
hours extra studying.

I also posted five blog posts about these topics on this site and spent around 10 hours writing them, including
collecting and analyzing resources, deciding on the structure, etc. Then I spent around 8 hours reading study notes,
and around 10 hours for practice exams.

Overall, I spent 68 hours studying for CompTIA Security+. This is a big investment that I would never do if I wasn't
following structured content and if I wasn't pursuing a concrete goal.

### What's New?

I must tell you how surprised I'm after seeing how little has changed in Cyber Security after two decades. OWASP Top 10
vulnerabilities aren't very different than what I remember. SQL Injection is still there, XSS/CSRF is still popular,
malware hasn't changed much, and so on. Especially tools used in cyber security, haven't changed either.
I remember using [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) more than 10 years ago, and it's still
actively maintained! Nmap, wireshark, john the ripper, nikto, cain and abel, aircrack-ng, nessus - I remember
all these tools from decades ago.

Just think about how much has changed in software engineering in the past two decades! ASP is dead, almost no one uses
Perl anymore, Adobe Flash is dead, ActiveX is dead, PHP heavily lost it's popularity, we have low-code and no-code
solutions now, AWS/GCP is eating the world, we have Kubernetes, Ruby and GoLang are popular kids, languages like Kotlin
and Scala shined in the JVM world, and so on.

Compared to software engineering and infrastructure fields, cyber security stayed very stale. If I can comfortably
continue from where I left I'm not sure if this is a good sign or not for the field.

By the way, I took the exam and passed successfully ðŸŽ‰ I also find CISSP interesting, because of my current position,
but time will tell when I'll get it.

Cheers.
