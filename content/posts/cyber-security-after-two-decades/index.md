### Nostalgia

I got my first computer in 1998. I remember having my father pay around 3000$ for it. GPUs back then didn't look any
different than a dull sound card. They didn't look like the modern GPUs of today with fancy cooling units, adaptive
coloring, and huge fans.

1998 was also the year of [CIH (Chernobyl)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIH_(computer_virus)). CIH was able to destroy
a system BIOS, and a BIOS chip replacement was needed afterward. It was a devastating moment when CIH destroyed my PC
as an 8-year-old kid, who was only interested in playing Street Fighter there.

Then I got a new PC, GPUs got 3D support, and the Internet adoption started to speed up. Chat rooms and forums have
been the thing at the beginning of the 2000s. I’ve been spending most of my time in the chatrooms of a Harry Potter
related website as a 10 years old kid. One day in the chat room I noticed a group of people with colorful usernames,
blue, red, and yellow. I was amazed. My username was dull black, not even bold or italic styling, like the majority of
the room. Of course, those other cool kids didn’t tell me how they did it, but it was something very cool and unique
for me.

These two events made me learn HTML and CSS all by myself, and probably shaped my whole life. If you aren't a native
English speaker you will get how hard this is. I had literally zero tech books written in my native language, which is
Turkish and I didn't know any English either. Learning resources on the Internet have been quite limited, very often
they didn't even exist, and using the Internet with a
[56K modem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xalTFH5ht-k&t=96s) was an expensive activity.

One thing led to another and I started learning about cyber security from online forums, probably as a result of
the traumatic CIH experience. I don't know if the term _Cyber Security_ existed back then, but how we call this field
of interest was just _hacking_. I say _field of interest_ because Cyber Security wasn't really an industry in those
years.

For a couple of years, I was heavily invested in cyber security. I was trying all tools I can find online, such as
keyloggers, trojans, viruses, and I was testing all vulnerabilities that I can find on random targets. Typical
script-kiddie story.

Looking at my [zone-h](https://www.zone-h.org/) profile (_no, I will not tell my username_) at the end of the day with
pride and honor was a daily activity.

I also witnessed the development and progress of "hacking" communities in Turkey from the beginning.

[ayyildiz](https://web.archive.org/web/20060522012413/https://ayyildiz.org/),
[redhack](https://web.archive.org/web/20120201074317/https://red-hack.org/), and many others. I have seen their births,
growths, and deaths. Turkey today, is still one of the most
active countries in cyber-security, together with India, the USA, Brazil, Ukraine, and Russia.

One thing led to another and I started writing articles for [OWASP Turkey](https://www.webguvenligi.org/belgeler). The
first article there has published in 2006 by [Bedirhan Urgun](https://twitter.com/bedirhanurgun?lang=en), and then many
other famous early birds of the Turkish Cyber-Security scene, such as [Mesut Timur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtimur/)
(who works at Facebook nowadays), and [Ferruh Mavituna](https://ferruh.mavituna.com/) (founder of
[Acunetix](https://www.acunetix.com/) and [Invicti](https://www.invicti.com/) aka. Netsparker) participated in. People
publishing articles on OWASP has gone a long way.

Nowadays, none of my early articles are available online - but they can still be accessed on my
[archive directory](https://www.serhatdundar.com/archive/) (in Turkish).

Then I witnessed _grisapka.org_, one of the first examples of big-scale leak publishing websites in Turkey. I don’t
remember anyone from grisapka, but there was always a new leak, either a critical database, an e-mail list, or personal
information every day. The site has been shut down after a leak including all transactions of a Turkish bank, from all
local branches. It’s still a mystery to me who shut it down and who has been running the site. Laws around
cyber-security were very weak or didn’t even exist in those years. Probably none of the activities of this site have
ever been considered a crime because of a lack of laws.

I never earned any money from cyber security, and I only did software engineering during my entire career. Maybe it's
because being a "pentester" or a "security engineer" wasn't even a thing in the past. But after almost two decades, I
now work in a Cyber-Security [company](https://www.cobalt.io/), providing "Pentest as a Service".

### Getting Certified or Not?

I don't believe in IT certifications. They rarely prove that an engineer is capable, especially in the software
engineering field. I also find it funny and pointless when I see profiles on Linkedin with _"10x AWS certified"_
headlines. If you haven't done any meaningful infrastructure work on a large scale, you can have a thousand certificates
and they won't mean anything.

However, the certification business is still taken seriously in cyber security, compared to other fields.

I only find certifications useful because of a set of structured studies one needs to complete for obtaining them.
This structured way of studying for them reminds me the college, and this is a feeling I enjoy once a year, or once
every two years. Certifications simply keep me on track, and I like not having to do study planning for myself
sometimes.

Long story short, I recently decided to get a CompTIA Security+ certification, just to see what has changed over the
years.

### CompTIA Security+

If you aren't familiar with cyber security certifications, CompTIA is one of the certifications that covers everything.
Therefore it's not good for specializing in a specific topic or demonstrating expertise in a particular area. It can
also, be considered as an entry-level certificate, but also don't expect it to be so easy because they're shoveling you
with content, almost about any dimension of cyber security.

I followed the [CompTIA Security+ course](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/) of Jason Dion on Udemy. It's
a comprehensive resource with 22 hours of video, and 168 pages of study notes. However, I gave many breaks when I'm
following the course and did further studying on the topics that I'm interested in. Namely, SSL/TLS, hashing functions,
symmetric and asymmetric encryption, public key infrastructure (PKI), and so on. I watched over 70 videos on Youtube
about these topics and refreshed my knowledge. On average a single YouTube video was 15 minutes, so it took around 18
hours of extra studying.

I also posted five blog posts about these topics on this site and spent around 10 hours writing them, including
collecting and analyzing resources, deciding on the structure, etc. Then I spent around 8 hours reading study notes,
and around 10 hours on practice exams.

Overall, I spent 68 hours studying for CompTIA Security+. This is a big investment that I would never do if I wasn't
following structured content and if I wasn't pursuing a concrete goal.

### What's New?

I must tell you how surprised I'm after seeing how little has changed in Cyber Security after almost two decades. OWASP
Top 10 vulnerabilities aren't very different than what I remember. SQL Injection is still there, XSS/CSRF is still
popular, malware hasn't changed much, and so on. Especially tools used in cyber security, haven't changed either.
I remember using [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) more than 10 years ago, and it's still
actively maintained! Nmap, wireshark, john the ripper, nikto, cain and abel, aircrack-ng, nessus - I remember
all these tools from decades ago.

Just think about how much has changed in software engineering in the past two decades! ASP (not .NET) is dead, Adobe
Flash is dead, ActiveX is dead, Pascal is dead, PHP and Perl are almost dead, AWS/GCP is eating the world,
we have Kubernetes, Ruby was born, grew up, and isn't the popular kid in the room anymore, languages like Kotlin and
Scala shined in the JVM world, and so on.

Compared to software engineering and infrastructure fields, cyber security (at least for "practitioners") stayed very
stale. If I stopped coding and come back after a decade, I would probably be no different than an alien. But cyber
security... It wasn't any different at all. Of course, I'm not saying the industry didn't progress. At the end of the
day, I wouldn't be working in a cyber-security company if I didn't believe in this industry. According to my
observations, the pace of development in the industry was just different for practitioners and enterprises.

Cheers.
